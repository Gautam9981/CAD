# CAD
CAD software (with CLI tools and a GUI tool (eventually) as well)

Day 1 (5/31/25)

So far, today was the groundbreaking day for this project. I didn't get too far, however, I have a decent foundation. I intend to make a terminal application that can run a GUI (at the discretion of the user) and make .stl files that can be read by platforms such as Fusion or Solidworks. So far, it can generate cubes and sphere shapes, which shows up as meshes in Solidworks. I intend to make a gui for this as well, as lightweight as possible, with the assistance of others.

Day 2 (6/1/25)

Now I can sketch basic lines and circles and points! However, I can't necessarily make it look exactly clean in Solidworks, but it exports it as a .dxf file and it loads. I realized that the biggest issue wouldn't necessarily be the code, but, rather the documentation of the code, so I would need help documenting the code properly. This repo is public, so anyone can see it
