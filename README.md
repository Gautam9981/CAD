# CAD
CAD software (with CLI tools and a GUI tool (eventually) as well)

Day 1 (5/31/25)

So far, today was the groundbreaking day for this project. I didn't get too far, however, I have a decent foundation. I intend to make a terminal application that can run a GUI (at the discretion of the user) and make .stl files that can be read by platforms such as Fusion or Solidworks. So far, it can generate cubes and sphere shapes, which shows up as meshes in Solidworks. I intend to make a gui for this as well, as lightweight as possible, with the assistance of others.
